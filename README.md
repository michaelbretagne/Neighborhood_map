# Neighborhood_map

This application was created as my submission for the **project 6** of [Udacity's Full Stack NanoDegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004).

##Project Description: 

This is an **interactive map** of the most popular parks, playgrounds or hikes in the neighborhood of your choice based on yelp reviews.

###Note:
The app is **mobile friendly** but you will get the full experience and have access to more feature on a desktop.

##Feature:
- A weather icon and the temperature of the current neighborhood is displayed on the navbar (not available for mobile phone).
- You can choose to display the top 10 parks, playgrounds or hikes by clicking on the appropriate button.
- The places can be filtered by typing a name in the search input 
- A clickable list of the places is available which show the details about the places.
- When you click on a marker it will open an info window that shows the address of the places selected.
